<h1> High Frequency Trading System </h1>

High-frequency trading (HFT) is algorithmic trading characterized by high-speed trade execution, an extremely large number of transactions, and a very short-term investment horizon. HFT leverages special computers to achieve the highest speed of trade execution possible. It is very complex and, therefore, primarily a tool employed by large institutional investors such as investment banks and hedge funds.

<ul>
<li><h3>Ingestion</h3></li>
Simple Ingestion via streaming binanace API ingesting trade recordes and order book records in real time. For prototyping used simple web socket. For scaling can use Apache Kafka and scaling win AWS could use kinesis services
<li><h3>Load</h3></li>
For real time stream processing database is not mandatory eventhough to store some content SQL lite is used. It can be scaled to a dedicated timeseries storage database or some non relational databases for scalability and reliability. Along with these records the performed actions are also stored and the assets and capital records are also maintained
<li><h3>Transform</h3></li>
Not much transformation required in the data itself only some necessary comparisions and calculations done to make decisions. Decisions made on the basis of real time streaming data compared to the stored data. For simplicity backtesting libaries are used to make high frequency trades
<li><h3>Act</h3></li>
Finally to perform trade buy-sell same binance api can be used.
<li><h3>Visualization</h3></li>
All the data generated by processing making actions and ingesting data that were stored initially are visualized via python library.
</ul>

<h2>Outputs</h2>
This prototype schematic High frequency trading system used binance API along with python binance package to handle the api. Stream was ingested with the help of web socket. Then using simple functions the buying selling and storage were simulated finally the visualization was also simulated.
